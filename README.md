# UserPhoneBook-spring-boot
Spring Boot project with Rest API and Unit tests, db PostgreSQL

To test this project you need to have PostgreSQL db which called "recorddb"
on port 5432 OR you need to refactor file application.yml using your database recourse.

I use Postman to test this project, also i have Unit test in file UserControllerTestMVC
